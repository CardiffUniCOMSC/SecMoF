# Examples and Templates

* Projects
  * **Dependency Model and IR Playbook Projects**
    * [example-project.zip](Projects/example-project.zip): Contains a basic Dependency Model and Playbook. Use this project as a base to help create your own.
    * [workshop-example-sqli-injection.zip](Projects/workshop-example-sql-injection.zip): Contains an expanded use case for small translation company. There is a small dependency model and playbook process linked. The scenario is malware has been detected on one of their file servers.
  
  * **IR Playbook Projects**
    * [CACAOex.zip](Projects/CACAOex.zip) and [IACDex.zip](Projects/IACDex.zip): Two FRIPP projects from the paper "Model-Based Incident Response Playbooks"[^1]. CACAO's example details a preventative playbook for the malware FuzzyPanda. The IACD example details mitigateion of a high risk device. 
  
* Dependency Model Examples

  * [SCADA.dependencymodel](DependencyModelExamples/SCADA.dependencymodel): The complete SCADA model from the paper "*A Configurable Dependency Model of a SCADA System for Goal-Oriented Risk Assessment*"[^2]
  * [example-probabilities.dependencymodel](DependencyModelExamples/example-probabilities.dependencymodel): An example dependency model showing simple probabilities and relationships. 
* Playbook Templates
  * [Web Injection Analysis.fripp](PlaybookTemplates/web-injection/injection-attack-analysis.fripp) and [Web Injection Containment/Eradication.fripp](PlaybookTemplates/web-injection/injection-attack-containment-eradication.fripp): An example of a detailed IR Playbook showing the Analysis, Containment, and Eradication phases. *By Muhammad Huzaifa Jamil*.
